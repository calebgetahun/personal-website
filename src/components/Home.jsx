        Hey, I'm Caleb! I like to code, lift heavy circles, and solve puzzles
        (among many other things).
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently building systems-oriented projects at the intersection of
        algorithms, backend infrastructure, concurrency, and applied AI - things
        like a Rubik’s Cube solver with computer vision. Previously, I spent
        about two years working on infrastructure at LinkedIn.

      <p>
        I graduated from Duke University, where I studied Computer Science and
        Mathematics. While there, I tutored Data Structures & Algorithms and
        Linear Algebra, and served as a TA for a graduate-level course in iOS
        Mobile Programming.
