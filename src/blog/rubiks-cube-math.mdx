# The Theory of the Rubik’s Cube

The first time I ever learned to solve the Rubik's Cube was in the 6th grade. I used the little instruction pamphlet that came with it to solve it over the next few days. I didn't know why any of what I was doing worked or how someone could even think of these algorithms. I hope to demystify some of that today through the lens of computer science and mathematics.

Group theory shows up in many aspects of life. I remember learning about it for the first time in Abstract Algebra at Duke and having a tough time wrapping my head around it

- The set of all possible rubiks cube permutations closed under the operation of making a face change is a Group
